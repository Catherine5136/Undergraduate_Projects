# Project Experience

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in science at UBC, with a combined major in Statistics and Economics. Both majors strongly emphasize using data to find factors or relationships affecting real issues, which has broadened my view on how data reveals potential insights about the inconspicuous factors of the world. 

Specifically, several projects from statistics courses required looking for factors affecting the amount spent on wine and wine quality by using linear regression, with shrinkage methods like Ridge regression and Lasso to analyze model. Furthermore, in Econ 490, a detailed data analysis was applied to discover the impact of trade activeness on long-term economic growth. We use natural logarithm transformation to convert GDP per capita into a more normalized distribution, make it easier to linearize the relationship and model the growth rate. Use absolute value to calculate the natural log and modified it to a negative value if the original data is negative, to overcome the issue of taking log on negative numbers. Adding squared term to non-linear relationship and correct the regression model using code in Stata when heteroskedasticity and serial correlation were found.
